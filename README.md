# JSE
Primarily just a Balance checking interface. You need your own API key and UserID. Clone the repo as you will.

As it stands on commit, it will crash because I havent finished on the Ledger interface. I left that broken on 
purpose because I have a working copy anyway on my iPhone - so if you don't want the Ledger just disconnect it.
Too easy.

I will fiddle with this from time to time. You won't have any joy trying to put htis on the Apple App store. They are 
very funny about using JSE, the name JSECoin, and crypto currencies in general. I've so far been in review about
six weeks as of the date of this README creation, and answered a thousand questions. Very
understandable from their point of view, but frustrating none the less.

So if you can use the code - go for it. If you want to make committs then get in touch. My contact details are her on
GitHub somewhere. If you want to donate JSE to me - well you know where to find me. 
I'm also on the Telegram channel.
